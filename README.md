21 SCHOOL PROJECTS

My first library, which repeats the functions of the C standard library.

Also this library contains one more 21 school project - GetNextLine - which behaves like C++ std::string.get_line method.

The compilation was performed as follows: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror.

All files pass to Norminette.

No memory leaks.
